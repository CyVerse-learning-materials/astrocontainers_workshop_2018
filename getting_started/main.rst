All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our workshop are required
to follow this code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code
throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to

for more information on codes of conduct.

**FAIR principles**

AstroContainers supports FAIR data principles by providing services that help make data
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Participants will get an introduction
to containers and learn how to create and manage containers.

**Learning objectives**

Participants will learn key containerization concepts for developing
reproducible analysis pipelines, with emphasis on container lifecycle
management from design to execution and scaling.

The workshop will cover key concepts about containers such as defining the
architecture of containers, building images and pushing them to
public and private repositories as well as how to scale your
analysis from laptop to cloud and to HPC systems using containers.

**Who should attend?**

Faculty, researchers, postdocs, and graduate students who use and analyze data of all
types (genomics, image data, from animals, plants, etc.).

**Workshop level**

This workshop is focused on beginner-level users with little to no previous container
experience.

Intermeidate and advanced users who attend will gain a better understanding of and ability with container capabilities
and resources, including deploying their own tools and extending these analyses
into Cloud and HPC.
