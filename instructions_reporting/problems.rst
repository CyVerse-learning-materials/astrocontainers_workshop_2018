**Problems? Bugs? Questions?**
==============================

- If there is a bug and you can fix it: submit a PR. Make sure that I know who you are so that I can thank you.

- If there is a bug and you can't fix it, but you can reproduce it: submit an issue explaining how to reproduce.

- If there is a bug and you can't even reproduce it: sorry. It is probably an Heisenbug. We can't act on it until it's reproducible, alas.

- If you have attended this workshop and have feedback, or if you want somebody to deliver that workshop at your conference or for your company: you can contact one of us!
